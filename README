This project is an attempt to participate in 
"CS240h: Functional Systems in Haskell"
http://www.scs.stanford.edu/11au-cs240h/

all labs are usually done in the appropriate labs/labs<N>/task.hs file, 
so to run it you should do:
  cd labs/lab<N>
  runghc task.hs <PARAMS> 

where <PARAMS> depends on the lab
